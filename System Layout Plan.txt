This is the rough plan so far. Feel free to add, change, or comment

Landing Page
	-Selection list (check boxes)
		-Tiered or straight list?
		-Categories? (restaurants, sports, video game, tabletop game, coffee etc)
	Submit button
	
Generated page
	-Name
	-Description
	-Business information (address, website, phone number)
	-Google Maps widget?
	
Database
	-contains locations and their corresponding tags
	-fetch and display locations that match over a certain threshold of chosen tags (user defined threshold or preset?)
	-instead of percent match maybe only top X (top 5, top 10, etc))
	-if categories are used only display from the selected category (category MUST match?)
