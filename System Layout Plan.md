# System Layout Plan

This is the rough plan so far. Feel free to add, change, or comment


## Landing Page
- Selection list (check boxes)
	- Tiered or straight list?
	- Categories? (restaurants, sports, video game, tabletop game, coffee, exercise etc)
- Submit button
	
## Generated page
- Name
- Description
- Business Information 
	- Address
	- Website
	- Phone number
- Google Maps widget?
	
## Database
- Contains locations and their corresponding tags
- Fetch and display locations that match over a certain threshold of chosen tags (user defined threshold or preset?)
- Instead of percent match maybe only top X (top 5, top 10, etc))
- If categories are used only display from the selected category (category MUST match?)
